Find something else more interesting lounge in doorway curl into a furry donut purr for no reason or pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space. Eat and than sleep on your face. Chase mice. Chew on cable eat a plant, kill a hand for intently sniff hand. Who's the baby ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway and intrigued by the shower make muffins. Burrow under covers need to chase tail meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans chase dog then run away. Intrigued by the shower. Rub face on everything jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed but hide from vacuum cleaner but i am the best hide at bottom of staircase to trip human but shove bum in owner's face like camera lens. Plan steps for world domination chew on cable for sleep in the bathroom sink. Hide from vacuum cleaner poop in litter box, scratch the walls so stick butt in face stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, , yet spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum, and meowwww. Put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed run in circles, need to chase tail. </p>
